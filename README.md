Thanks for downloading Spacebar Smashers!
First of all, I am OBSSESSED with using .md instead of .txt README's (random fact)
Welcome to the world of Spacebar Smashers, a spacebar pressing game which unlocks different 
backgrounds for each 100 presses! This beta or public release is currently in version 0.1.4!

===========================================================================================================

HOW TO PLAY:

The point of the game is just to spam your spacebar as long as you want, and unlock different
backgrounds for every 100 presses! This game is also available as an open source project on my GitHub
