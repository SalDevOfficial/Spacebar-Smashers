to do list for updates for spacebar smashers (im really lazy)

- fix error when closing window
- draw a unmute sfx button
- make highscore save
- add a ton more backgrounds
- maybe get better music
- add a shop (upgrade n stuff)

p.s: if u wanna support an awfully small dev, u can donate at this link: https://streamlabs.com/saldoesstuff1/tip

it would be a bro move if u played the game and made a video about it but if not then no biggie
